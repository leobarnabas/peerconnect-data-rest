            Safety Tips and Other Suggestions by PCG</p>
            <p>We at PCG are thrilled about the Peer Connect Ghana Mentorship Program, and we wish you many interesting conversations with your new mentor/mentee. The organization and structure of your meetings and conversations is a matter for you and your partner to determine yourselves, but we ask you to be respectful of one another and always be aware that your language skills will not always be equal and your backgrounds may be diverse. Please also bear in mind cultural differences and sensitivities, especially regarding different culturesâ€™ attitudes toward alcohol, drugs and sex/gender. Please also try to respect the interests of your partner as well as the skills (written, oral, listening, etc.) which that person may wish to work on and the topics you would like to discuss with your mentor/mentee.
            PCG wants you to have a safe and secure experience with PCGMP. Please take a few minutes to read the following safety tips to keep your exchange experience enjoyable and secure.
            Fraud</p>
            <p>PCG recommends you NEVER share your personal or financial information with people you donâ€™t know well. Make sure to follow these guidelines at all times when meeting new people online:</p>

          <ul>
              <li> DONâ€™T ever send money to someone you meet online, especially by wire transfer. Keep in mind that wiring money is like sending cash: the sender has no protections against loss. Scammers often insist that people wire money, especially overseas, because itâ€™s nearly impossible to reverse the transaction or trace the money. Donâ€™t wire money to strangers or to someone who claims to be in an emergency (and wants to keep the request a secret).</li>

            <li>DONâ€™T give out your credit card number or bank info.</li>
            <li>DONâ€™T share your personal info, such as Social Security number, address, phone, etc.
            PLEASE report any suspicious activity or behavior to us immediately at eshama@peerconnectgh.com. Itâ€™s better to be safe than sorry, especially when it comes to your money.</li>
            </ul>

            <p> <b>Practical Tips </b></p>
            <p>You are in control of your Peer Connect experience at all times. If you feel unsafe or threatened, cease communication and report any misbehavior immediately by sending an e-mail to eshamo@peerconnectgh.com and contacting the police if necessary. PCG recommends you remember the following guidelines while participating in PCGMP:
            <ul>
            <li>CEASE contact with any PCGMP participant who behaves or treats you in an abusive way and report the behavior to PCG immediately.</li>
            <li>STOP communicating immediately with anyone who pressures you for personal or financial information.</li>
            <li>REMEMBER, your involvement will help keep the community fun and enjoyable. Report any suspicious activity or behavior to us immediately at eshamo@peerconnectgh.com.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>First Meetings</b></p>
            <br>First meetings are exciting! However, please take precautions and use the following guidelines:</br>
            ALWAYS meet in public. Meet for the first time in a populated, public location â€“ never in a private or remote location.</br>
            DONâ€™T meet at your house or place of work or give that information out until you have had a good opportunity to know the other person better.</br>
            TELL a friend. Inform a friend or family member of your plans and when and where youâ€™re going. If you own a mobile phone, make sure you have it with you.</br>
            LIMIT alcohol consumption or abstain entirely until you know the person better.</br>
            USE your own transportation, even when meeting someone who lives a great distance away from you. Itâ€™s never a good idea to get into someoneâ€™s personal vehicle on a first meeting. Wherever possible, drive yourself or take a taxi.</br>
            DONâ€™T leave personal items unattended. You donâ€™t want to risk having personal information stolen.</br> If youâ€™re drinking, keep your drink with you at all times so it canâ€™t be tampered with.</br>
            STAY in a public place. It is best not to go back to your peer partnerâ€™s home or bring them back to yours on the first meeting. If your mentor/mentee pressures you, end the meeting and leave at once.</br>
            REPORT any suspicious activity or behavior to us immediately at eshamo@peerconnectgh.com.<br>
            By bearing the above elementary safety tips in mind, you will be able to keep your PCGMP experience fun, safe and secure. Thanks for your participation!
